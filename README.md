# Non-realtime audio programming example in Java

Edit the `Main.java` file to experiment with different audio processing techniques.

If using a distribution of Linux with `apt`, you can compile just run `./run.sh` and it will take care of compiling and running the Java code and playing the resulting sound file for you.

On other Unix systems (such as macOS), you'll need to have Java installed and available on the command line. Then run `javac *.java && java Main`. This will generate a file called `output.wav` containing the output audio.
